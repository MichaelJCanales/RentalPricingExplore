## Project Description

We were given a dataset provided by a real estate company to "clean" up errors and to extract an analysis of rental properties. The dataset contained various information of each property. To the houses age, location and the price of the units area. It also provided the number of convenience stores and the distance to the nearest MRT station. 

We use the data to see how it will influence the rental housing prices. We explored the distribution of the variables in the dataset and plotted histograms, scatter plots, and a heatmap to visualize the data. To predict the rental housing prices we'll use a linear regression model to  evaluate and to explain and assess the rental prices. 

### Challenges 
* Numeric column interpreted as a string
* Column not relevant to the analysis
* Rows with missing values 
* Long column names
* Unknown units (distance , currency)
